Key Steps and Methodology
The project involves the following key steps:

Defining the Problem Statement: Analyzing Netflix’s content strategy to recommend actions for content production and subscriber growth.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, converting categorical variables, extracting insights from non-standard data like lists (e.g., country, cast).
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Non-Graphical Analysis: Value counts, unique values, missing value detection.

Recommendations: Providing actionable suggestions for Netflix's content strategy and regional growth, based on the analysis.
Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we offer several key insights, such as:

Netflix should focus on producing more regional content for countries with fewer offerings to increase market penetration.
Genres such as documentaries and thrillers show growing trends, and Netflix should produce more content in these categories.
Family-friendly content is popular in several regions, and investing in such content could increase subscriptions from family audiences.
Investing in long-running TV shows with multiple seasons can help retain subscribers for a longer duration.
